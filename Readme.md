# LocalChat

This is a unique type of chat app which I was creating for the **Refine + Dev Hackathon**. But I was not able to complete it in time.

So I restart the project from scratch.
But this time with slightly different approach.
Since the Hackathon required a CRUD app I was implementing User login, User Data storage, profile pic storage to make it a very minimum **CRUD** app.
At that time I was totally new to **TypeScript**, so as you expected I was not able to complete it and submit it.

This time I will do it in few steps

- version 1

  In version 1, I will just create the **Frontend** for sending and receiving messages and the **Backend** web socket.

  Nothing more.

- version 2

  User login and other stuff will be added.

- version 3

  More stuff will be added if required

- version n (if needed more version will be added)

  I don't think I will even complete version 3.

## Status

- [ ] version 1 ( in progress )
- [ ] version 2
- [ ] version 3

## To Do

- [ x ] create frontend for large screen
- [ x ] create backend
- [ x ] connect frontend and backend
- [ ] edit stylings for small screen
- [ ] display sender name beside all messages
